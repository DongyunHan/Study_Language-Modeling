    "#### 1. The first issue I realised is that, during the cleaning process, negation words are split into two parts, and the ‘t’ after the apostrophe vanishes when I filter tokens with length more than one syllable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The second issue I realised is that, some of the url link doesn’t start with “http”, sometimes people paste link in “www.websitename.com\" form. And another problem of this regex pattern is that it only detects alphabet, number, period, slash. This means it will fail to catch the part of the url, if it contains any other special character such as “=”, “_”, “~”, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The third issue is with the regex pattern for twitter ID. In the previous cleaning function I defined it as ‘@[A-Za-z0–9]+’, but with a little googling, I found out that twitter ID also allows underscore symbol as a character can be used with ID."
